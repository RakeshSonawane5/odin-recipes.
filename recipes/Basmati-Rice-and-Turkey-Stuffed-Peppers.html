    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            &#10004; Step 1

            <p>Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            &#10004; Step 2
            
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            &#10004; Step 3
            <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and parsley; cook for 2 minutes. Add ground turkey, salt, and garlic power. Cook and stir using a wooden spoon until meat is no longer pink and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and 1/2 cup chicken broth. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. Add cooked rice and stir stuffing well.</p>
        </li>    

        <li>
            &#10004; Step 4
            <p>Fill each bell pepper half with stuffing and arrange neatly in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover each pepper with a handful of shredded Cheddar cheese. Pour remaining chicken broth into the bottom of the baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil.</p>

        <li>
            &#10004; Step 5 
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese is browned, about 5 minutes more. Serve right away.</p>
